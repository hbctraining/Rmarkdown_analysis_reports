# Generation of R Analysis Reports using RMarkdown

| Audience | Computational Skills | Prerequisites | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Anyone | Beginner/Intermediate R | Working knowledge of R/RStudio | 3 hour workshop|

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **3 hour**, hands-on **Generation of R Analysis Reports using RMarkdown** workshop led at a relaxed pace. 

Reproducible research is as important for computational analysis as it is at the bench. Integrating your R data analyses into a report format allows for easy retrieval of the packages/versions and code used to generate your results and figures. It allows for efficient communication of your results with your collaborators. The **knitr** R package allows for the easy generation of professional reports for any R analysis, while allowing for customization and easy revision. In this 3-hour workshop, we will cover the simple RMarkdown syntax and explore options for customizing your reports.

### Learning Objectives
*  **Understand Rmarkdown syntax and available features:** Exploring the syntax of the Rmarkdown language and different available features.
*  **Utilize `knitr` for report generation:** Practicing with `knitr` and different `knitr` options for customizing reports.

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
